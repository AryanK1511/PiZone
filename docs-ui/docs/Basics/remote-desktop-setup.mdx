# Remote Desktop Setup with TigerVNC on Raspberry Pi

This guide is inspired by [David Bombal's YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K1hUwxxYek), but with more detailed explanations aimed at beginners. By following these step-by-step instructions, you'll be able to set up a VNC server on your Raspberry Pi running Ubuntu, making it accessible remotely.

## Step 1: Prerequisites

Ensure that you have:

- A Raspberry Pi running Ubuntu
- SSH access to your Raspberry Pi from your computer
- The Pi connected to the same network as your computer

## Step 2: Find Your Raspberry Pi’s IP Address

Run the following command to find your Pi's IP address:

```bash
hostname -I
```

This will give you the IP address you'll need to connect to your Raspberry Pi using a VNC client.

## Step 3: Update Your System

Start by updating your system packages. Open a terminal (or SSH into your Raspberry Pi) and run:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

## Step 4: Install X11VNC (VNC Server)

Now, install **x11vnc**, which allows you to share your Pi’s screen over the network:

```bash
sudo apt install x11vnc
```

## Step 5: Set Up X11VNC as a Service

To make X11VNC start automatically every time your Pi boots, you need to create a system service.

1. Open the systemd service file for editing:

   ```bash
   sudo vi /lib/systemd/system/x11vnc.service
   ```

2. Add the following content to this file:

   ```bash
   [Unit]
   Description=x11vnc service
   After=display-manager.service network.target syslog.target

   [Service]
   Type=simple
   ExecStart=/usr/bin/x11vnc -forever -display :0 -auth guess -passwd password
   ExecStop=/usr/bin/killall x11vnc
   Restart=on-failure

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

- **ExecStart**: This command starts the VNC server. Replace `password` with your chosen VNC password.
- **Restart=on-failure**: Ensures that if the service fails, it will restart automatically.

3. After saving the file, reload the systemd configuration to register the new service:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   ```

4. Enable the service to start at boot:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable x11vnc.service
   ```

5. Start the service now:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start x11vnc.service
   ```

6. Check the status of the service to make sure it’s running:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status x11vnc.service
   ```

### Step 6: Prevent Screen Locking

To prevent the screen from locking on your Raspberry Pi running Ubuntu through the command line, you can disable the automatic screen lock and screen blanking using `gsettings`. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Disable the automatic screen lock:**

   Run the following command to turn off automatic screen locking:

   ```bash
   gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.screensaver lock-enabled false
   ```

2. **Set the screen to never blank:**

   Use this command to prevent the screen from turning off:

   ```bash
   gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.session idle-delay 0
   ```

   This sets the idle delay to `0`, meaning the screen will never blank.

3. **Disable the screensaver:**

   If you're using a screensaver, you can disable it with this command:

   ```bash
   gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.screensaver idle-activation-enabled false
   ```

These commands should effectively prevent the screen from locking and going blank when you're using your Raspberry Pi remotely.

### Step 7: Connect Using TigerVNC

On your computer, install **TigerVNC Viewer** (or any VNC viewer of your choice). Open the viewer and input your Raspberry Pi’s IP address followed by `:0`. For example:

```txt
192.168.1.100:0
```

Input the VNC password you set up earlier, and you should now be able to see and control your Raspberry Pi's desktop remotely!
