# Raspberry Pi Guidebook

Welcome to the **Raspberry Pi Guidebook**! ðŸŽ‰

Iâ€™ve noticed that a lot of people are interested in using Raspberry Pi for hackathons, capstone projects, and personal projects. As someone who loves interfacing hardware with software, I decided to create this repository in order to have a one-stop shop for everything you need to know about getting started with Raspberry Pi's basic features.

The goal of this project is to make it easier for you to get up and running with your Raspberry Pi, no matter what you're building. It's meant to be a collaborative and fun space for us to share our knowledge with each other. Iâ€™m not an expert myself, and thatâ€™s okay! This project is about learning and growing together. So, whether you're building IoT systems, home automation, or just tinkering for fun, this guide will help you along the way.

## Raspberry Pi Setup

For reference, I'm using a **Raspberry Pi 4** with **Ubuntu Desktop 24.04.1 LTS (64-bit)** installed via the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-imager-imaging-utility/). Everything in this repository assumes you're using the same setup. While many things should work regardless of your configuration, if something doesnâ€™t, now you know why!

If youâ€™re not familiar with installing an OS on your Raspberry Pi, you can follow the [official guide](https://ubuntu.com/download/raspberry-pi) to get started. Here's the basic process:

1. Download the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) for your operating system.
2. Select Ubuntu Desktop 24.04.1 LTS (64-bit) as the OS.
3. Flash it onto your SD card.
4. Boot your Raspberry Pi and follow the installation instructions.

### Why Ubuntu Desktop?

I've chosen **Ubuntu Desktop** because it provides a full desktop environment with all the flexibility of a Linux-based system, making it ideal for development projects. Whether you're running scripts, developing software, or setting up servers, Ubuntu offers a user-friendly experience with lots of support from the community.
